# Personal Site Roadmap (MVP → v1)

## Phase 0 — Current status
- Site is live on GitHub Pages
- Core pages exist (home, blog index, posts, 404, sitemap, robots)
- Base positioning and contact details are in place

## Phase 1 — MVP lock (1 week)
Goal: credible professional site that drives contact.

1. Clarify services on homepage
   - Add 2–3 service cards (who it is for + outcome + CTA)
2. Reduce contact friction
   - Add a primary CTA above the fold ("Varaa 20 min kartoitus")
3. Publish 2 cornerstone posts
   - Ennakointi päätöksenteossa (not theory)
   - AI in B2B operations (practical, no hype)
4. Add trust signals
   - Explain working method (fact vs interpretation vs hypothesis)
   - Add 2–3 concrete outcome examples
5. Technical hygiene
   - Verify canonical, sitemap coverage, and internal links

## Phase 2 — v1 (2–4 weeks)
Goal: steady inbound and stronger authority.

1. Content cadence
   - 1 high-quality post/week
   - Categories: ennakointi, AI käytännössä, asiakasprosessit
2. Lead path
   - Add one downloadable checklist/brief (optional email capture)
3. Brand + domain
   - Decide custom domain
   - Add OG image + favicon
4. Measurement
   - Connect Search Console (+ analytics optional)
   - Track: organic traffic, top pages, contact clicks
5. Light case pages
   - Add 2 mini-cases (challenge → approach → impact)

## Phase 3 — Growth (1–2 months)
Goal: differentiation and compounding visibility.

- Build one thematic hub page for 2026 perspectives
- Publish comparison posts (including when NOT to do something)
- Consider monthly digest/newsletter if publishing remains active
